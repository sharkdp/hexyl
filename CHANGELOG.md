# v0.8.0

## Features

- Added a new `--skip <N>` / `-s <N>` option to skip the first `N` bytes of the input, see #16, #88
    (Thanks to @Tarnadas, @MaxJohansen)
- The `--length`/`--bytes`/`--skip` options can now take units for their value argument, for example:
  ``` bash
  hexyl /dev/random --length=1KiB
  hexyl $(which hexyl) --skip=1MiB --length=10KiB
  ```
  Both decimal SI prefixes (kB, MB, …) as well as binary IEC prefixes (KiB, MiB, …) are supported.
  In addition, there is a new `--block-size <SIZE>` option that can be used to control the size of the `block`
  unit:
  ``` bash
  hexyl /dev/random --block-size=4kB --length=2block
  ```
